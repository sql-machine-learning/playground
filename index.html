<!-- Please don't delete this file!

This file is generated by https://github.com/bramp/goredirects. We
need it because github.com/sql-machine-larning/sqlflow is too long a
Go import name.  We want it to be sqlflow.org/sqlflow.

Our solution is to build a Website https://sqlflow.org, whose page
http://sqlflow.org/sqlflow/index.html contains some meta information
readable by the Go toolchain, so that the `go get` command knows that
`import sqlflow.org/sqlflow` actually redirects to `import
github.com/sql-machine-larning/sqlflow `.

We build the Website by the following steps.

1. We configure https://sqlflow.org pointing to
http://sql-machine-learning.github.io, which is a Github Page Web site
built from the repo
github.com/sql-machine-learning/sql-machine-learning.github.io.

2. We make sure that /sqlflow in the repo
github.com/sql-machine-learning/sql-machine-learning.github.io is a
git submodule pointing to this repo,
github.com/sql-machine-learning/sqlflow.

3. We put the meta information in this file as follows.

Similarly, please don't remove any index.html in this repo that were
marked generated by https://github.com/bramp/goredirects.
